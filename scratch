Windows Deployment Services (WDS) is a server role in Windows Server that allows administrators to deploy Windows operating systems to client computers over the network. WDS uses the Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE) to boot client computers into a Windows Setup environment that allows administrators to install the operating system remotely.

WDS provides a centralized location for storing and managing Windows installation images, which can be customized with specific configurations, drivers, and applications. These images can be deployed to multiple client computers simultaneously, which can save time and effort compared to manually installing the operating system on each machine.

In addition to deploying operating systems, WDS can also be used to deploy custom images, capture images of existing installations, and provide multicast transmission of images to reduce network traffic. WDS also supports automation through scripting and command-line tools, which can further streamline the deployment process.

Overall, Windows Deployment Services is a powerful tool for deploying Windows operating systems and images to client computers over the network, which can save time and effort for IT administrators while ensuring consistency and standardization across the organization.
