Centralized Management: WDS provides a centralized location for storing and managing Windows installation images, which can be customized with specific configurations, drivers, and applications. This makes it easier for IT administrators to maintain and update images, and ensures that all installations are consistent and standardized.

Faster Deployment: WDS allows for remote deployment of Windows operating systems, which can save time and effort compared to manually installing the operating system on each machine. Multiple client computers can be deployed simultaneously, which can further reduce deployment time.

Reduced Costs: By automating the deployment process, WDS can reduce the costs associated with manual installations and maintenance. It also ensures that all installations are standardized, which can reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies.

Improved Security: WDS supports custom images that can be pre-configured with specific security settings and software, which can improve the overall security of the operating system. It also provides support for Secure Boot, which helps prevent unauthorized operating system or firmware from running during startup.

Multicast Transmission: WDS supports multicast transmission of images, which can reduce network traffic and improve deployment times by transmitting the image to multiple clients at once.
