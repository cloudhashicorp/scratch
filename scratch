Upgrading the infrastructure of a fleet of Windows desktops involves several key steps to improve their security, manageability, and functionality. One of the first steps is joining the desktops to Azure Active Directory (AD), which provides centralized identity management, multi-factor authentication, and single sign-on capabilities. Another important step is upgrading the network subnets to improve performance and reduce network congestion. This can involve segmenting the network into smaller, more manageable subnets, optimizing routing and switching, and implementing network monitoring and management tools. Additionally, the use of Microsoft Endpoint Manager can help streamline the deployment and management of software and security updates, as well as provide device management and reporting capabilities. These steps can help ensure that the fleet of Windows desktops is secure, reliable, and optimized for business operations.
