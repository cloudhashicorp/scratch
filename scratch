Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service provided by Microsoft that allows organizations to manage and secure access to various resources, including applications, devices, and data, in a centralized and efficient manner. Azure AD can be used to manage user accounts, assign permissions, and authenticate users across multiple cloud and on-premises applications and services.

For workstations, Azure AD can be used to manage user accounts and device identity, as well as to enable secure sign-in and access to resources. By integrating with Windows 10 devices, Azure AD can provide a seamless and secure sign-in experience for users, with the ability to enforce policies and control access to resources based on factors such as user location, device health, and network conditions.

Organizations can use Azure AD to manage and enforce policies for devices enrolled in their network, including the ability to remotely wipe or lock a lost or stolen device, enforce password policies, and control access to resources based on factors such as device compliance and risk level.

In summary, using Azure AD for workstations provides organizations with a centralized and secure way to manage access to resources and enforce policies for users and devices, while also providing a seamless sign-in experience for users across multiple devices and applications.
