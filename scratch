here are several methods for deploying security updates and software applications, including Windows Deployment Services, PowerShell, and PSEXEC. Windows Deployment Services is a built-in server role in Windows Server that allows for network-based installation of operating systems, device drivers, and applications. PowerShell is a command-line interface that enables IT administrators to automate administrative tasks and execute scripts. PSEXEC is a command-line tool that allows for remote execution of commands on a target system. A combination of these tools can be used to automate and streamline the deployment of security updates and applications, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of human error.
